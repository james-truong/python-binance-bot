Findings: This strategy netted me a negative profit! Please do not use this.

This strategy needs improvement and is flawed but will tweak along the way once I find a better trading strategy.
The main purpose of this project is to practice working with streams and having useful application with the Binance API + NumPy + TA libraries.
